# JesseCo Retail Manager
A retail management system built by JesseCo Enterprise Solution

Hello, this is a follow along project following IAmTimCorey's TimCo Retail Manager Course. The goal is to have a taste of WPF development and learn C# by doing.

## Project Goal
1. Demonstrate modern development techniques
2. Model how an application grows over time
3. Create a platform that needs to be upgraded to newer technologies
4. Create a platform to demonstrate how to incorporate new techniques or tools into existing software
5. Create a hands-on learning tool for developers to use to simulate a work environment

## Situation Setup
In this simulation, we work for JesseCo Enterprise Solutions. We build solutions that we can sell to clients. We have been assigned to build a retail management system.
Over time, we will get new requirements, or new work entirely, just like in a real job.

## Initial Project
Build a desktop app that runs a cash register, handles inventory, and manages the entire store. In order to allow it to grow, though, we will be creating a WebAPI layer.

## Initial Plan
We will build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that we can expand to cover all of the features we need over time. The first step is getting all of the major pieces set up, including:
* Git on Azure DevOps
* SQL database (SSDT)
* WebAPI with authentication
* WPF application that can log into the API

## Technologies Involved
* Git
* WebAPI
* Authentication
* Unit Testing
* SOLID principles
* Dependency Injection
* Design Patterns
* Async
* Logging
* Data Validation
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* WPF
* SSDT
* ASP.NET MVC
* .NET Core
* Azure DevOps
